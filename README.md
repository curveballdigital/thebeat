# Welcome to Pet Cuddle-o-tron CDK project

This project is a Typescript CDK implementation of Adrian Cantrill's [aws-serverless-pet-cuddle-o-tron](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs/tree/master/aws-serverless-pet-cuddle-o-tron).

The purpose of this repo is to codify the skills that I've learned from the course, learn CDK, and serve as a template for similar architectures.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute the app.

## Architecture

The architecture of the project will follow the architecture of Adrian's lesson.
